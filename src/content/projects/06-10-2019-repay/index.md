## Introduction

Adjustable loan amortization schedules are easy to find with a quick online search, but they often don't allow a user to calculate the effect of extra payments made towards the principal amount. Nor do they allow a user to balance strategies for repaying multiple smaller loans, as in the case of student loans, each of which has a different interest rate and attached repayment benefits (e.g., .5% interest rate reduction after 12 months repayment). This tool generates and visualizations amortization schedules for one or more loans based on user-provided loan data and allows users to compare different loan repayment strategies.
