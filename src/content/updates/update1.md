Welcome! I setup this website for two reasons. First, to have a central place to host and showcase various projects beyond the usual github repository. And, second to test out various techniques and tools 'in the wild' (more about that below).

## The technical rundown
The site is built with GatsbyJS, (ADD description and link). Built-in to Gatsby are several handy packages including GraphQL, which is used to query data for generating the site content(such as here and here). For the source code and a full list of dependencies, check out the github repo (link).

## Future plans
There is a short list of features and modifications to the site that I will be adding in due course along with irregular write-ups like this one discussing new projects, updates to old projects and the like.
