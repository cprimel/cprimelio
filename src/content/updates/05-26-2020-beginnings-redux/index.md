So, let's try that again. I setup this website a little less than a year ago as a place to showcase things I was working on at the time, mainly the Repay web application. In the interim, I've taken a step back to rethink and design it as a more expansive set of personal finance tools. Most of what would have been the Repay web app will have a home there as well but it became clear quite early on that it would make more sense if it could be integrated with other tools (budgeting, expense tracking, financial planning). The ETA for the larger project is to be determined as I am working on a handful of smaller personal projects, including a few tweaks to this site that will be more conducive to regular updates. More to come...
